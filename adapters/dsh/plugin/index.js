/**
 * dsh-engramory — the Engramory memory discipline as a DeepSeek Harness plugin.
 *
 * Two things the always-on AGENTS.md block cannot do on its own:
 *
 *   1. A DETERMINISTIC index cap. dsh's `ctx.tools.guard()` is a synchronous,
 *      monotonic refusal — once a guard returns a reason, no later waterfall
 *      listener can turn it back into an allow. That makes it a stronger seam than
 *      most hosts expose, and it is why the 200-line / 25 KB limit can be enforced
 *      here rather than merely asked for. Without a shim like this one, everywhere
 *      except Claude Code the cap degrades to "rules plus a checker the agent has to
 *      remember to run".
 *   2. Skill delivery that does not depend on install paths. Registering at runtime
 *      sidesteps the five-root scan entirely, so the protocol is present because the
 *      plugin is loaded, not because a directory happened to be right.
 *
 * The decision table mirrors hooks/engramory_index_guard.py: deny only a write that
 * ENDS over a cap AND grew past the current file — a shrinking rewrite always passes,
 * so an over-cap index can be compacted incrementally (210 → 205 → 198). Only known
 * mutating tools are gated; `read` and unknown tools are never refused (the first cut
 * gated everything that named the index, which blocked recall of an over-cap index at
 * exactly the moment compaction was needed).
 *
 * Zero dependencies, no build step: plain ESM, node: builtins only.
